When it comes to tackling issues in the areas of classification, regression, and non-linear control, neural networks provide a highly potent set of tools.
Studies on information processing processes in the biological nervous system, notably the human brain, served as an inspiration for neural networks.
In fact, a large portion of network research is focused specifically on better understanding these information processing mechanisms.
More particularly, we'll concentrate on the deep learning component of artificial intelligence. Deep learning for computer vision and
Deep learning for picture production will be given,using the free and open-source TensorFlow framework and a customized Keras library for model creation.
The objective is to employ these specific methods in the delicate field of medicine to avoid cancer; 
in fact, we'll concentrate on how to tell benign skin melanomas from malignant ones.
The first network, a Convolutional Neural Network, will allow us to distinguish between the
two classes of tumors by performing various convolutional operations on the images. The second network, 
a Deep Convolutional Adversarial Network, will allow us to recreate images of melanomas by pitting one network against the 
other to determine which is better at identifying real images from fake ones.
In order to enhance the convolutional neural network's training phase, it will also be crucial to employ the two networks sequentially.
This will compensate for the lack of data by utilizing generative networks, which will produce pictures of benign and malignant skin cancers.
